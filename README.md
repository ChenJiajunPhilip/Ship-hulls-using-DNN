# Ship-hulls-using-DNN
The repository showcases my work on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using Python libraries Jax and TensorFlow., while I worked as a Machine Learning engineer intern at A*STAR (IHPC). My work can be viewed in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ChenJiajunPhilip/Ship-hulls-using-DNN/blob/main/Ship_hulls_using_DNN.ipynb).

## Description
The shape of a ship's hull and how deeply a ship is submerged underwater affects the drag acting on it while moving through the water. Given that the shape of the shap's hull can be modelled by 45 arbitrary parameters with their associated values, I created a neural network that can predict what are the optimal values for these 45 parameters, given its draft (how deeply each ship is submerged underwater.
